# AMPR
Enhanced Automatic Number Plate Recognition Using OpenCV and EasyOCR

## Abstract:
This project delves into the development of an Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) system leveraging the capabilities of OpenCV and EasyOCR. The aim is to accurately detect and read vehicle number plates from images, enhancing the efficiency of traffic monitoring and management systems. The method involves preprocessing, edge detection, contour detection, and optical character recognition to extract text from number plates.

## Project Overview:
The project focuses on creating an ANPR system using Python, OpenCV, and EasyOCR. The system is designed to read vehicle number plates from various images, processing them through a series of steps including grayscale conversion, noise reduction, edge detection, contour detection, and finally text extraction using OCR.
